 Guess the number card game
 
 This is a game that will start off with a number or "card" and as you whether or not the next randomly pulled card is higher or lower in value to the current card. Once you choose, it will pull a new number and compare them alongside your answere. It will show you your score and then ask if you would like to play agin. 
  They main game runs through a class called GameSystem that holds most of the user interface. It pulls from two other classes, Cards and Numbers. The Cards class is just to return a randomized number. The Numbers class handles the changing of the score and tracking of the score with methods like AddPoints and LosePoints.
